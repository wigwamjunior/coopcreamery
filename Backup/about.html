							<h1>About the Co-op Creamery Cafe</h1>
							<p>The Co-op Creamery Neighborhood Café is located in “the old creamery building,” a historically important landmark for co-ops, local food, and the food networks they create.c</p>
						</header>
						<section>
							<p>Built in 1920 as a dairy production plant, the building was originally home to the highly successful Franklin Co-op Creamery Association, a milk and delivery co-op that would come to produce 80 percent of the Twin Cities’ milk supply in its heyday.</p>
							<p>The co-op that dominated the local food scene began as a group with just 13 members. They belonged to the Milk Wagon Drivers' Union, Local 471 organized on behalf of local dairy workers who worked seven days a week for unsustainably low wages. Believing in the power of co-ops, those 13 members incorporated themselves as “The Franklin Co-operative Creamery Association” in 1921, naming their co-operative venture after the avenue where their new plant was located.</p>
							<p>The co-op grew rapidly from the moment it opened. In March, 1921, “the Franklin” needed only 18 milk wagons to serve its customers, but by the end of its first year, the Franklin’s fleet had grown to 71 and sales had increased by over 200 percent. This extraordinary production served notice to its corporate competitors that the new co-op was a real economic force. By 1923, the co-op had 6,000 members, 381 employees making and delivering milk, butter, cheese, and ice cream to 35,000 loyal customers, and was the largest milk producer west of Chicago. By the early ’30s, the Franklin co-op was producing and delivering 80 percent of the Twin Cities’ milk.</p>
							<p>But as years went by, big national supermarkets came to dominate the U.S. food landscape, taking huge shares out of local food systems. By 1960, America’s food-buying habits had changed so dramatically that the Franklin Co-op Creamery Association began to falter, and the co-op’s home delivery of milk ended altogether. Not long after that, the Franklin closed its doors after a remarkable five-decade run.</p>
							<p>Today, Seward Co-op brings a cooperative and a local food hub back to the Creamery building after nearly 60 years. We’re proud to honor those original cooperators who had a vision for local democratic ownership and excellent food for everyone in Minneapolis. We hope you’ll raise a glass to their vision while you enjoy yourself at the Co-op Creamery.</p>
