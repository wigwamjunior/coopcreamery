										<h1>You Can Own the Co-op Creamery Cafe</h1>
										<p>The Co-op Creamery Café is operated by Seward Community Co-op. That means, current owners of the co-op are also owners of the cafe. Become an owner of the cafe and you also become an owner of the Seward Co-op. It's a win-win.</p>
									</header>
									<h2>Become an Owner</h2>
									<section>
										<p>People become owners of <a href="http://seward.coop" alt="Seward Co-op">Seward Co-op</a> for a number of reasons. Many people join for the quarterly discounts and owner specials. Others join to support a community-owned business that works to sustain the local economy. You do not need to be an owner to shop at the co-op, but if you decide to join you will enjoy numerous owner benefits. Learn more about ownership in Seward Co-op and our various payment options here.</p>

									<h3>What is Seward Community Co-op?</h3>
									<section>
										<p><a href="http://seward.coop" alt="Seward Co-op">Seward Co-op</a> is a natural foods cooperative that has been providing the community with the highest quality products and services since 1972. Today, the co-op has more than 13,000 owners and 230 employees. Seward Co-op is committed to offering healthful, locally grown or raised organic foods and wellness products.</p>
										<p>Seward Co-op opened in 1972 on the corner of 22nd and Franklin avenues. In the beginning we were run by a core group of volunteers and had a small selection of products with a heavy emphasis on bulk goods. By 1976 we had incorporated and established an elected board of directors.</p>
										<p>Over the decades, <a href="http://seward.coop" alt="Seward Co-op">Seward Co-op</a> has continued to grow — both in sales and ownership. In 2012, we celebrated our 40th anniversary. A year later, we announced a proposed second store, at East 38th Street and Clinton Avenue South. We are very excited about our new store, which we are calling the Friendship store. We see this as an opportunity to bring more people together around good food. The Friendship store will open in October 2015.</p>
										<p>Back in 1972, when the co-op took shape, few people could have imagined it would grow to be the thriving community center and source of healthful food it is today. From a few working volunteers, <a href="http://seward.coop" alt="Seward Co-op">Seward Co-op</a> has grown to more than 13,000 owners. Store sales are nearly $35 million, and the co-op now employs more than 230 people. What’s most important, though, is that amidst great success and profitability, the co-op has remained true to its Ends, never losing sight of its commitment to its owners and the greater community.</p>
